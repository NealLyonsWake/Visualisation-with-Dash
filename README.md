# Visualisation with Dash (Small Study Project)

## Note:
It was not possible to push the airline_2m.csv file to GitHub in the allocated timeframe due to its large size. Should you wish to use this repo, you can download the csv file [here](https://dax-cdn.cdn.appdomain.cloud/dax-airline/1.0.1/airline_2m.tar.gz?_ga=2.198942319.1119461549.1638211202-796443461.1638211202). Once it's downloaded, unzip the file and move it to the 'data' directory in the download project folder. 

## Assignment:
Use the dataset from [airline reporting carier ontime performance dataset](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/airline/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDV0101ENSkillsNetwork20297740-2021-01-01&cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork-20297740&cm_mmca1=000026UJ&cm_mmca2=10006555&cm_mmca3=M12345678&cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&cvo_campaign=000026UJ#get-this-dataset) to build a dashboard.
1. Import the required libraries and read the files.
2. Create an application layout.
3. Add a title to the application using HTML h1 component.
5. Add the line chart using the core graph component.
6. Run the app.

## Bonus (add these dash components to your dashboard)
1. Monthly average carrier delay by reporting airline for the given year.
2. Monthly average weather delay by reporting airline for the given year.
3. Monthly average national air system delay by reporting airline for the given year.
4. Slider component to enter input year.

#### Note: the year range should be between 2010 and 2020

# My Work Log:
1. All assignment requirements completed.
2. All bonus requirments completed.
3. Note that the assignment csv file is large and there is a small delay in starting the application on your server. Once the data has loaded the dashboard works as intended with no time delay.
4. Enjoy.
